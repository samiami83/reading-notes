# Growth Mindset
- A growth mindset is about believing that one can develop their fundamental abilities.
- In a fixed mindset, the belief is that ability comes from the application of inherent qualities that need not be developed any further.
- The growth mindset allows an individual to grow in almost any way they'd like as long as they're willing to put in effort. The fixed mindset does not.
###### In a [blog posting](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset) on Inside Atlassian Steve Haffenden had this to say:
> When I feel myself losing focus, I try to remember that short-term frustration will likely result in long-term improvement of my abilities – if I just stay with it. A growth mindset opens me up to more creativity and possibility, and I discover I’m able to achieve more and set higher goals.

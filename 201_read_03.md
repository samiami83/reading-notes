# HTML
## Lists
- HTML has three kinds of lists: ordered/unordered/definition.
- Numbers are used with ordered lists.
- Bullets are used with unordered lists.
- To define terminology definition lists are used.
- One can nest lists inside of other lists.

## Boxes
- As far as CSS is considered every HTML element occupies its own box
- CSS controls borders, margins, padding, display, and visibility properties of these boxes.
- Boxes can be changed from inline to block-level and vice versa.
- The ability to create image borders/rounded borders was introduced in CSS3.

# JavaScript
## Basic JavaScript instructions review
- Unlike a variable an array stores a list of values, not just one.
- Array values are accessed like they were in a numbered list.
- Array numbering starts at zero ex. [0,1,2,3,4,5]

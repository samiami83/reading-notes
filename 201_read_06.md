# The Problem Domain
- Understanding the problem domain is considered one of the hardest parts of software development.
- One should try to work from a familiar problem domain.
- Learning things incrementally is better than trying to learn everything at once.
- The better you can grasp the domain problem (what the client needs and/or is trying to accomplish) the easier coding will be.
[Here](https://simpleprogrammer.com/understanding-the-problem-domain-is-the-hardest-part-of-programming) is an article that covers the domain problem.

## Object Literals
- To create a realistic model of a real world scenario an object is used.
- Objects group together sets of variables and functions to accomplish this.
- Inside of an object, variables are known as properties. Properties describe the object.
- Inside of an object, functions are known as methods. Methods = Tasks
- Properties and methods are declared with names and given a value. The name they are given is aka **key**.
- Because keys are used to access their given value, two keys cannot share the same name inside of an object.
- Property value = a string, number, Boolean, array, or another object.
- Method value = a function, always.
- Objects are made up of a set of name (keys) /value pairs.
### Creating an object: Literal Notation
- Literal notation is the simplest and most common way of creating objects.
var hotel = {
  name: 'Quay',
  rooms: 40,
  booked: 25,
  checkAvailability: function() {
    return this.rooms - this.booked;
  }
};
Using the above as an example:
- The curly braces and their contents are what make up the object named _hotel_. 
- Each key is separated from its value using a colon.
- Each property and value are separated by a comma except for the last value.
- keyword: _this_ is is used in the _checkAvailability_ method to indicate that _rooms_ and _booked_ properties of this object are being used.
- Values for setting properties should be treated as they are for declaring variables ('strings in quotes',[arrays in brackets]).
### Dot Notation and accessing an object.
- To access the methods/properties of an object, dot notation is used.
- Square brackets can also be used to access properties.
- var hotelName = hotel.name: hotel.name is how you would access the _name_ property for the object called _hotel_.
- The period between the object name and property is called a member operator. The property on the right of the period is a _member_ of the object on the left of it.
- var hotelName = hotel['name']: shows another way to access the property _name_ for the object _hotel_.
- The [] method is commonly used when:
  - The name of the property/method has special characters.
  - The name of the property is a number (not advised).
  - A variarble is used instead of the property name (see Chap. 12).
## DOM - Document Object Model
- A page is represented in a browser using a DOM tree.
- The four node types of a DOM are: document nodes, element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes.
- Element nodes can be selected by: id or class attributes, tag name, or CSS selector syntax.
- When a DOM query returns more than one node, it will return a NodeList.
- An element node has content that can be accessed or updated using textContent/innerHTML properties, or through DOM manipulation techniques.
- Element nodes can contain more than one text node and child element as siblings.
- Implementation of the DOM is inconsistent in older browsers, jQuery is commonly used because of this.
- The DOM tree can be viewed using built-in browser tools.

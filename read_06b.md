# Computer Architecture and Logic
## What is a computer?
- A computer is roughly the equivalent of mechanical machine used to help with physical work, but it helps with thinking work (information processing).
## How do computer work?
- A computer needs to be able to do the following:
    - Accept input
    - Store data
    - Process data
    - Perform output
- At its core a computer functions using binary data.
- Information can be input to a computer in a variety of ways. At some point the information has to be converted into binary data, which is the only data a computer can truly process.
- Simple logic circuits used together create more complex circuits that allow for a computer to process data very quickly.

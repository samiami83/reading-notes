# Dynamic web pages with Javascript
- It is typical for three languages to be used when creating web pages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- HTML is where the content of the page lives. It gives structure and adds semantics.
- CSS enhances the HTML using *rules* to determine how the content is displayed.
- JavaScript is used to change how the page behaves, including adding interactivity. (js should be kept in separate files AMAP)
- Progressive enhancement is a popular method for building web pages.
## JavaScript
- Like HTML and CSS, JavaScript is written in plain text so no new tools are necessary to write a script.
- When you want to use js with a web page, use the HTML script element.
- When the browser encounters a script element, it loads the script and checks to see if there is anything else to do.

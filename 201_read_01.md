# HTML

## Structure
- HTML is basically text docs structures as pages.
- HTML gives special meaning to information through the use of tags (<akhjjsh>)
- Tags are aka elements
- Tags almost always come in pairs, opening tag marks the start and closing tag marks the end.
- Opening tags can have attributes, they provide info about the content of the given element.
- Attributes need both a name and value.
- Know what tags go where and how they operate.

## Extra Markup
- DOCTYPES are how a browser knows what kind of HTML is being used.
- To comment place code between <!-- comment here --> markers.
- Class and id attr. allow for identification of particular elements.
- <div> and <span> elements let block-level and inline elements be grouped together.
- <iframes> let you make windows in your page through which other pages can be displayed.
- <meta> tag allows one to supply info about a page.
- Escape characters let you use special characters in your page.

## HTML5 Layout
- HTML5 has new elements that denote diff parts of a web page and describe its structure.
- These new elements allow for cleaner code vs using multiple <div> elements.
- Browsers that don't use HTML5 elements need to be told that something is a block-level element.
- Extra js is needed to make HTML5 elements function properly in IE8 and older versions, this is available on Google for free.

## Process & Design
- One must understand the whos and whys of those that visit your site.
- Site maps are useful for planning your site structure
- Wireframes help one organize the info that will go the page.
- Think of how visual hierarchy will help you design communicatively.
- There are many ways to set pieces of info apart from each other. Size, color, and style for example.
- Grouping and similarity make it easier for one to present info.

# JavaScript

## The ABC of Programming
- JavaScript is best kept in its own file separate from HTML
- HTML uses <script> to tell the browser to load the js file
- Inspecting the elements of a page shows that js doesn't change the HTML, it works with model of the page to display the changes.

# Design web pages with CSS
## Introducing CSS
- To understand CSS, imagine that every HTML element is surrounded by an invisible box.
-CSS allows for the creation of rules, these rules control the way that each box and it's contents are presented individually.
- CSS associates rules with HTML elements which govern how content of specific elements will be displayed.
- CSS rules contain a *selector* and a *declaration*.
- Selectors indicate the element to which rules will be applied.
- Declarations determine how the indicated element is styled. Declarations have two parts; a property and a value.
- Properties indicate which aspects of the element will be changed (color,font,etc.)
- Values specify the settings you want to use for said properties.
## Color
- Color brings your site to life. It also sets the mood and can help to get a reaction out of visitors.
- The three ways to specify colors in CSS are: RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
- Color pickers are useful for finding a color you want.
- One must make sure there is enough contrast between the text and background on your site for visitors to be able read content.
- CSS3 introduced and opacity indicator for RGB colors (RGBA), and allows for specification of colors via HSL values with optional opacity (HSLA).

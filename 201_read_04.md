# HTML

## Links
- <a></a> is used to create the link element
- href is used within the <a> to define the page you are linking to.
- Relative links can be used to link to pages within the same site.
- Links can be created to open a users email client with a pre-addressed email.
- To link to specific elements of a page, id attributes are used.

## Layout
- For grouping together sections of a page, <div> elements are used as containing elements.
- Normal flow is the default way that browsers display pages. You can choose to have it display in relative, absolute, or fixed positioning if you so choose.
- To move content to the left or right, or to layout the page in a multi-column style one would use the float property. A defined width is required for a floated item.
- Page layouts are either fixed-width or liquid.
- A well designed page would be kept at a width that allows for important/relevant content stays near the top to be seen easily. (960-1000px wide/Top 600 px)
- To make adaptable professional designs one should consider a grid layout.
- Multiple CSS files can be attached to one page.

## Perks of Pair Programming
- Article about the subject [here](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/).
- Big takeaways:
  1. It leads to greater efficiency. Having code scrutinized by two devs produces higher quality code that needs less revisitation.
  2. The collaboration increases how engaged the programmers are by the experience. Having someone else depend on you, makes it less likely that you'll lose focus.
  3. Makes it so that developers can learn from each other. Because devs have different areas of expertise and know slightly different ways to accomplish similar tasks, new techniques and methodologies can be picked up from the interaction that occurs.
  4. It can improve social skills. Having to share who is doing the driving/navigating means being able to articulate a thought is important. If you want the driver to do something specific in the code, as the navigator you'll have to find a way to get it across witout you being able to actually write code.
  5. Helps prepare one for interviews. It is not uncommon for pair programming exercises to be a part of the interview process. It also shows if you can work well with others.
  6. It can only help one to be more ready the work environment. Every dev knows how to code alone. Knowing how to pair program means that you can code alone, but can also work with someone if the task requires it.

# Programming with JavaScript
## What is a script
-A series of instructions that the computer can follow to accomplish a goal.
-When a script only part of the instructions may be followed/used
-People and computers are distinct in how they accomplish tasks, computers perform tasks programmatically.
-Write scripts as a smaller series of tasks, that complete a main task.
-Flowcharts are helpful.
## Expressions
- An expression evaluates into a single value. Generally, there are two types.
1. Expressions that assign a value to a variable. Ex. var color = 'beige';
2. Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value.
Ex. var area = 3 * 2;
## Operators 
- Operators are relied upon by expressions, allowing programmers to create a single value from multiple values. Ex. =, +, *, <, >, etc.
## Functions
- Functions allow for the performing of specific tasks by letting one group series of statements together.
- The statements in a function are not always executed when the page loads, thus letting you store the steps needed to accomplish a task.
- If you're going to ask the function to perform its task later you need to give the function a name. Ideally the name given describes the task the function will perform. When you later ask it to perform its task, this is known as 'calling' the function.
### Declaring a function
- Naming a function then writing the statements needed to achieve said function is referred to as a function declaration.
### Calling a function
- After declaring a function, you can then execute all of the statements between its curly brackets with just one line of code. This is known as calling the function.

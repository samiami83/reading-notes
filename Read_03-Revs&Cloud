# Version Control System
## What is a VCS?
- VCS is a system used to revisit older versions of a file or set of files by keeping a record of changes to those files.
### Local Version Control
- A local VCS uses one database on hard disk to store changes to files.
### Centralized Version Control CVCS
- The need for collaboration on development projects led to the creation of the CVCS.
- In this system a single server stores all changes and file versions, this server can be accessed by various clients.
### Distributed Version Control System DVCS
- This system addresses the major vulnerability of the CVS: the server as a single point of failure.
- A DVCS allows users to create a mirrored repo. These backups can easily replace any lost information on the server.

# HTML
## Text
- HTML elements define the page structure (headings/subheadings/paragraphs).
- Semantic info is also provided by HTML elements.
## Introducing CSS
- Each element in HTML exists in its own box as far as CSS is concerned. Rules are used to define how each 'box' is displayed.
- Selectors and declarations make up these rules. Selectors define which element to apply rules to, and declarations determine how the selected element will be displayed.
- Declarations contain properties, and values that change those properties.
- Typically CSS rules (like js) are kept in separate document, but can be placed inside of an HTML doc as well.

# JavaScript
## Basic JavaScript Instructions
- Scripts are basically a series of logical steps.
- Very particular instructions are used in scripts. Like declaring a var before calling it.
- Variables temporarily hold info used in scripts.
- Arrays are var that hold multiple pieces of related info.
- JavaScript knows the diff between numbers, strings, and Boolean values.
- A singular value is the output of an evaluated expression.
- Operators are used when an expression calculates a value.

## Decisions and Loops
- Conditional statements decide what the code should do next next when more than one option is present.
- To compare two operands, comparison operators are used (===, !==, ==, !=, <,>,<=,=>)
- To combine multiple sets of comp operators, logical operators are used.
- if...else allows one set of code or another to be run depending on if a condition is true/false
- You can compare a value to possible outcomes using switch statements, they also have a default option if no values match.
- One can change data types.
- Values are either truthy or falsy (binary,effectively)
- Loops repeat a set of statements. There are three kinds: for/while/do

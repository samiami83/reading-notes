## Domain Modeling
- A process for creating a conceptual model for a particular problem.
- A well made domain model proves your understanding of the problem.
(Taken directly from [here.](https://github.com/codefellows/domain_modeling#domain-modeling)) 
**Summary**:
1. >When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
2. >Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
3. >Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
4. >Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
5. >Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
6. >Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.

## Tables
- To add a table to a web page the <table> element is used.
- Each row in a table is created with the <tr> element.
- In a table, <td> is used for cells, and <th> if the cell is a header.
- To make cells of a table span ("stretch") multiple rows/columns using _rowspan_ and _colspan_ atrributes.
- <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot> can be used to split a long table.

## Functions, Methods, and Objects
- Functions can be used to group code blocks together and form a single task from them.
- Functions need parameters to do perform their task. The can be made to return a value as well.
- A group of variables and functions that model something IRL is an object. 
- Inside of an object, variables = properties, and functions = methods.
- The browser window and the document loaded into the window are represented by implemented objects.
- A number of objects are already built into js include: String, Number, Math, and Date. They help you write scripts.
- Objects and arrays can be contained within one another, and can be used for complex data sets.

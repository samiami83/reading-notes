# HTML
## Images
- To add images to a web page use the <img> element.
- It is necessary to specify an attribute (src) to indicate the images source. An alt attribute has to be included to describe the content of an image.
- Save images in the appropriate size and format that you'll use on the web page.
- It's best to save illustrations or logos with flat colors as .gif and photos are best saved as .jpeg.

## Colors
- I have good notes on color and its uses [here](read_05.md)

## Text
- To control font, size, weight, style, and spacing choices, certain properties are used.
- Most people have a limited number of font choices installed.
- To use a broader range of fonts you'll probably need some that are only usable with a license.
- Space between pieces of text, and also how the text is aligned/indented can be changed.
- To change the style of an element interactively, psuedo-classes can be used (ex:hovering over an element/previously visited link).

## JPEG vs. PNG vs. GIF
- Interesting article [here](https://blog.imagekit.io/jpeg-vs-png-vs-gif-which-image-format-to-use-and-when-c8913ae3e01d) about the differences between .jpeg, .gif, and .png image files. It also covers when best it's best to use a certain kind:
  - PNG: Best for images that require transparency/high contrast/sharpness.
  - JPEG: Best for scenes of nature/smooth color transition and intensity.
  - GIF: Best for animations/illustrations.

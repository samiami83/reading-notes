## Error Handling & Debugging
- Understanding the two stages of execution contexts and stacks, will help you to better find problems in your code.
- Debugging involves deduction and is term used for when one goes to work finding and eliminating "bugs"(errors) in code.
- The console is very useful for honing in on problems because it provides specifics about the errors including the line in which the error is located.
- JavaScript has 7 types of errors. Each error makes its own error object. The error object is what gives you a description of the error as well as the line number location.
- When you think that there will be an error, the statements 'try', 'catch', and 'finally' lets you give users useful feedback.
